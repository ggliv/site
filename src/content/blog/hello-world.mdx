Yesterday I read through [this excellent thread on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081) where people were encouraged to post their personal blogs. I've been thinking about making a blog of my own for a while now, but this post and the examples shared within it were a tipping point for me. I think I would benefit from having an entirely independent platform to share my thoughts, experiences, and expertise. Whether readers may benefit is of secondary concern.

So I guess this is my 'hello world' of a blog post. Let's see where this goes!
